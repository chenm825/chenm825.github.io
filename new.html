    <h2> If you are a single adult: </h2>
    <h3><b> Finding a shelter for the first night: </h3> </b>
    <p>The Callahan Consent Decree guarantees that homeless single adults have a right to shelter and certain standards for shelter placements.
      If you have nowhere to sleep, walk into an <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/get-help/i-need-shelter/#1">intake office</a>
      and let the City know that you have no where to stay. You have the right to receive a shelter placement the same night.</p>
    <h3> <b> Once you applied at an intake office:</h3> </b>
    <p>If you end up having to sleep on the floor, settling on a chair in a shelter, or being bused after midnight:</p>
    <p>Call the Coalition of the Homeless on the hotline:(855-692-2384). Leave a message with your name, date of birth, phone number and shelter.
      If you don't have a place to sleep, you should visit the <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/get-help/i-need-shelter/#1">intake office</a>
      to speak with an advocate in the Crisis Intervention Program at the Coalition. Arrive early in order to sign in and see an advocate. If you didn't have
      any place to sleep at night, make sure to mention this to the security guard whenever you arrive.</p>
    <p><b>If there are no issues:</p></b>
    <p>You won't have to go through a eligibility process, but there is an assessment period of about 21 days to determine where you will be placed. You will
      be transferred to another shelter for assessment or stay at your original intake shelter. Once the assessment is complete, DHS will transfer you to
      an “official shelter” where you can stay for a longer period of time. Your official shelter site might change while you are in shelter.</p>
    <p><b>During your official placement:</p></b>
    <p>The Callahan Consent Decree guarantees access to resources and conditions in your shelter placement. You must receive a bed
          frame, a mattress, and a locker and lock. Your bed must be 3 feet apart from the other beds in the shelter. During your stay, you are guarenteed
          access to linens, basic toiletries, and laundry services among other things. The Peoples Callahan outlines all of your rights in more detail.

    <h2> If you are a family with children: </h2>
    <p><b>If you have nowhere to stay:</p></b>
    <p>You have a right to shelter if there is no other safe, available housing option. You are allowed to apply for shelter 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
      You can find information on applying for shelters and the required documents <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/get-help/i-need-shelter/#4">here.</a>
    <p><b>When you apply for shelter:</p></b>
    <p>You will meet with a diversion worker who will try to help you avoid entering shelter. This worker may offer benefits, help with moving, or discussions to
      look for any other options for permanent housing. This worker is not part of the shelter application process. You still have a right to apply for shelter
      no matter what was discussed in diversion. If you still need shelter after speaking with diversion, you will meet with a family worker who will ask you where you
      have lived in the past two years. Make sure to tell the worker where you stayed and all the reasons why you had to leave. </p>
    <p>You will be provided with shelter that night and for approximately 10 days after. During this time, PATH will investigate your eligibility. They will visit
      and call places you have stayed and people you have lived with to see if there are any housing options available to you. You may also be given appointments to
      return to PATH during this time. At the end of the 10 days, DHS will make a decision, if you are eligible or ineligible for shelter.</p>
    <p><b>If not found eligible for shelter:</p></b>
    <p>You have the right to reapply any time with no waiting period. However, the City can deny shelter to some families when they believe another housing option is
      available. If you need assistance with your application for shelter, come into the Crisis Intervention Program.
    <p>The City MUST give you shelter when you re-apply if:</p>
    <p> - You or your child would be in immediate danger if you do not receive shelter. "Immediate danger" includes any medical reasons.</p>
    <p> - You have new facts, information, and/or documents, or if your circumstances have changed.</p>
    <p> - You (or the primary tenant) have just been evicted from the last place you stayed. </p>
    <p> - Your child is the victim of child abuse, and the abuser lives in the last place you stayed or can find your child. </p>
    <p> - You are a domestic violence victim, and your abuser lives in the last place you lived or can find you.</p>
    <p> - You are re-applying more than 90 days after last having been found ineligible for shelter.</p>
    <p>The City must also give you shelter if you were found ineligible because:</p>
    <p> - You “failed to cooperate.”</p>
    <p> - You “failed to demonstrate that you are a family unit.”</p>
    <p> - You had to miss appointments at PATH.</p>
    <p> - You were “logged out” before your application was decided.</p>
    <p> If the City finds you ineligible when you re-apply but:</p>
    <p> - You have a shelter placement </p>
    <p> - You receive a discharge notice </p>
    <p> - You are threatened with loss of shelter</p>
    <p> - You are denied shelter when you seek it </p>
    ...go to the <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/our-programs/crisis-services/crisis-intervention/">Crisis Intervention Program</a> as soon as possible.

    <h2> If you are a family without children: </h2>
    <p><b>If you have nowhere to stay:</p></b>
    <p>You have a right to apply for shelter and have your application considered by the City. The application office, called the Adult Family Intake Center (AFIC),
      is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. find information on where to apply for shelter or the documents you will need in order to apply <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/get-help/i-need-shelter/">here.</a></p>

    <p>You will meet with a worker who will ask you where you have lived in the past two years. Make sure to tell the worker where you stayed and all the

    <p>The HS, HRA and other City and State agencies have an obligation to provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities including
      modifications to policies or procedures when necessary. Examples of accommodations include flexible scheduling of appointments, access to interpreters,
      assistance with reading and completing forms, and bed passes. If you need an accommodation, you can make a request by talking to your case manager
      in the shelter or at HRA. You and your doctor may also need to submit a reasonable accommodation request.  If you need help making a request for

    <h2>After Your Shelter Stay</h2>
    <p><b>Quarter House Arrangements:</p></b>
    <p>A three-quarter has more than one person per room, often in bunk beds. The people don't have a secure place to lock up their possessions. The housing itself
    usually doesn't have a lease, with poor conditions and unsafe overcrowding. </p>
    <p>Rooms for rent can often be illegal as well.  These rooms are often empty bedrooms or basements in a lease holding tenant’s home.  All landlords wouldn't
      allow for subleases, so it is important to ask for a lease when considering a room for rent. The arrangements being offered may not be legal, putting you in
      danger in the event of an emergency.</p>
    <p>It’s important to know that room finders are for profit businesses. If you give a room finding service money, be prepared that there is a possibility you
      may not be directed to a room and may not be able to get your money back. Living in a basement or an illegally occupied dwelling could put you at risk
      in event of an emergency. Multiple three-quarter houses have been shut down by the city for fire safety and code violations. Dozens of shelter residents
      who moved to three-quarter houses and rooms have had to come back to shelter.</p>
    <p>Go see any housing option offered by shelter staff and write down what you see. Ask to see the unit you will live in before you move in. If the landlord
      or shelter cannot arrange for you to see the room, write this down and ask the shelter staff to include this in your file. You are not required to accept
      a housing option you have never seen. If you believe the home is illegally occupied and the program or primary tenant cannot provide you with a lease,
      let the shelter staff know, in writing, that you don’t believe that it is legal to rent the room. Therefore, you would be uncomfortable with the placement.</p>
    <p>If you have other concerns about a room, come to the <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/our-programs/crisis-services/crisis-intervention/">Crisis Intervention Program</a>
      and talk to an advocate before you decide to move in.  Let your case manager know you can’t make a decision until you talk with an advocate.</p>
    <p><b>Conditions to be Removed from Shelter:</p></b>
    <p>Under the “Client Responsibility” procedure, individuals and families can be removed from the shelter system for a minimum of 30 days if DHS claims that
      they did not comply with:<p>
    <p> - an “independent living plan” (ILP)</p>
    <p> - housing search requirements</p>
    <p> - facility rules concerning health and safety</p>
    <p> - scheduled appointments</p>
    <p> - saving requirements</p>
    <p>Under these rules, shelter residents could be removed from shelter for breaking curfew or missing appointments, for not complying with shelter savings plans,
      or other so-called “violations.”  Residents cannot be removed from shelter if they have a mental or physical condition that makes them unable to follow these
      rules, although proving this is sometimes difficult.</p>
    <p><b>Apartment Search:</p></b>
    <p>When searching for housing, know that New York City law explicitly prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of lawful source of income, including
      rental subsidies – meaning it is illegal for landlords to turn you away just because you would pay rent with a voucher such as CityFHEPS, FHEPS or Section 8.
      If you believe that you have experienced this type of housing discrimination, please report it through one of these resources:</p>
      <br> - Contact the NYC Human Resources Administration’s Source of Income Unit at 929-221-6576 or soi@hra.nyc.gov. </br>
      <br> - File a complaint with the NYC Commission on Human Rights through this online form or by calling 311 or 212-306-7450. </br>
      <br> Call the Fair Housing Justice Center at 212–400-8201 or toll-free at 1-866-350-FHJC.</br>

    <h2>During any extreme weather conditions: </h2>
    <p><b> In any extremely cold conditions:</p></b>
    <p>The Department of Homeless Services will enact a policy called “Code Blue” for winter nights when the temperature drops to 32 degrees or below, including
      wind-chill, between 4:00 PM and 8:00 AM. On these nights Department of Homeless Services policies are relaxed to ensure everyone is warm and safe. </p>
    <p>Code Blue includes:</p>
    <p> - Drop in centers are required to take as many clients as possible, within the Department of Buildings restrictions.</p>

    <p> - Anyone in need of a warm place to go can walk into hospital emergency room.</p>
    <p><b> In any unusually warm conditions:</p></b>
    <p>The Department of Homeless Services has a policy called “Code Red” for extreme heat. Code Red Level 1 is in effect from 12pm-8pm when forecasted high
      temperatures reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher for one day or more, or are forecasted to reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit or higher at any point for two
      consecutive days or more. Code Red Level 2 declaration occurs when forecasted high temperatures reach 105 degrees or more Fahrenheit for any duration or
      are forecasted to reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit for four days or more. It is in effect continually for the duration of the extreme heat.
    <p>Code Red includes:</p>
    <p> - Drop in centers are required to take as many clients as possible, within the Department of Buildings restrictions.</p>
    <p> - Anyone in need of a place to go can walk into single adult or family shelters, without undergoing typical intake and eligibility procedures for the
      night in question.</p>

    <p> - Cooling buses may be provided.</p>
    <p> - More outreach teams will be on the streets to offer services and shelter.</p>
    <p> - No shelter suspensions or sanctions can be carried out on these dates. Clients who have been sanctioned can return to the shelter for the night in question,
      if necessary.</p>
    <p> - Anyone in need of a cool place to go can walk into hospital emergency room.</p>

    <h2>Voting Rights: </h2>
    <p>In 1984, Coalition for the Homeless filed the lawsuit Pitts v. Black, which guaranteed the right to vote for homeless New Yorkers living in shelter, on the street,
      or in welfare hotels. You don't need anything in order to vote. Arrive at your poll site on election day. As long as you registered to vote before that year’s
      deadline, you do not need to show identification in order to vote. You can vote in the district where you now live, even if you registered to vote or previously
      voted in a different neighborhood. For more information about your poll site, contact the NYC Board of Elections at 1-866-VOTE-NYC.
    <p><b>When you enter the voting poll:</p></b>
    You will see tables and voting machines set up for your election district and others. At the table for your district, you will be asked to sign next to a
    facsimile of your signature on an alphabetized, computerized polling list. If your name does not appear on the roster, ask for an affidavit or paper ballot.
    <p><b>If I had committed a felony or currently on parole:</p></b>
    <p>If you have finished your sentence, your rights have been reinstated and you are eligible to register and vote in this year’s election.</p>
    <p>If you are currently on parole: Some people on parole can vote, some cannot. If you are unsure, you can check your status online at voting.nyc.
      Even if you are currently not able to vote, you will regain your right to vote at the end of your parole period, and you may register and vote at that time.</p>
    <p><b>Otherwise:</p></b>
    <p> If your name does not appear on the computerized polling list or you are told that you are not eligible to vote, ask for an affidavit or paper ballot.
      After each election day, the Board of Elections will check its records, and your vote will be counted if you are indeed eligible to vote. If not, you will
      receive a notice that you are not eligible, along with a registration application for future elections. You may also call one of the numbers listed below
      for assistance on the day of the election.</p>
